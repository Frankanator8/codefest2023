## Clowning Around
Frank Liu and Matthew Fang's submission for Codefest 2023 at CHS

## Description
Game that allows you to turn any video into a moving platformer!

You can submit a video in the Generate Outline tab, and it will produce an "outline" video that just contains the outline of the video.

Then, you can play the video, along with the outline, with another person!

The outline will act as the "platform", and it's your job to stay alive for as long as possible - in other words, don't touch the bottom of the map!
If you feel the desire to, use your "Force" ability to push your opponents away and (hopefully) make them lose!
You can use power ups to double jump, have a bigger Force, or a saving grace for if you die
